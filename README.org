#+TITLE: Tiny CHIP-8

This reporsitory contain my CHIP-8 interpreter written in Ocaml, using only the
official Graphics library. It is aimed to be small : only 256 lines of code
(without blank lines and comments). It currently only works with Linux
distributions using pulsaudio but it can be easly ported to other OS because
it's only a problem of media player.
* Install
Intsall the Graphics library and the dune build system using opam if you haven't
already:
#+BEGIN_SRC
opam install graphics dune
#+END_SRC
I'm using an azerty keyboard so the keyboard layout of the interpreter is suited
for it, if you have a qwerty keyboard you can adjust the layout using the
included patch, using this command:
#+BEGIN_SRC
patch -p0 < patches/qwerty.patch
#+END_SRC
Then build the interpreter using the following command :
#+BEGIN_SRC
dune build chip8.exe
#+END_SRC
* Usage
To run a game, use the following command :
#+BEGIN_SRC
dune exec -- chip8.exe "the game"
#+END_SRC
